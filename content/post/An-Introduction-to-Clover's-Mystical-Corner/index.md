Hola! My name is Clover if you didn't know and I'm making a blogging website and it's mostly for my class.
P.S.(They are awesome !!!!)
This is going to be for the year and I'm going to write a bunch of blogs. I'll be posting  mostly on 
saturdays but sometimes on fridays. Some good parts of this blog is that you can write blogs for my Mystical website.
You can have your own page too. Sometimes we'll have skits and we are hoping we can do the news every month!
I'm very exited for this year and I hope you enjoy this Mystical journey through these blogs.


Love Clover
